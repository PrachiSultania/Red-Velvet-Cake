RECIPE FOR RED VELVET CAKE
To make this red velvet cake, you’ll start by whisking together your dry ingredients: 
all purpose flour,  cocoa powder, baking soda, and salt.

Then, mix up the wet ingredients starting with some  butter and sugar.

Once the butter and sugar are creamed together, you’ll beat in two eggs  until well combined. Then mix in the rest of the wet ingredients: some oil, red food coloring, vanilla extract, and  vinegar. 

Once you’ve mixed up the wet ingredients, you’ll alternate mixing the dry ingredients in three additions with some buttermilk.

Once the cake batter is mixed up it will be a beautiful bright red color Then, just divide the batter between two 9-inch cake pans and bake them for about 30 minutes. If you want to make it easier to get the cake layers out of your pans I suggest using butter paper or grease with oil .

Once the cake layers are baked and cooled, you’ll mix up the frosting. 

Then, just level your cakes and frost it however you like.
